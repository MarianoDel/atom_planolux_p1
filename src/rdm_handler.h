/**
 * @defgroup rdm_handler RDM Request Handler
 * @brief The handler for RDM requests.
 *
 * The RDM Handler manages dispatching the RDM requests to the correct model.
 * This allows the physical device to simulate different types of RDM devices
 * from LED drivers and moving lights to sensor-only devices and fog machines.
 *
 * Only a single model can be active at once, the PID_DEVICE_MODEL parameter
 * can be used to change models at run time. Note that PID_DEVICE_MODEL and
 * PID_DEVICE_MODEL_LIST aren't included in SUPPORTED_PARAMETERS so they are
 * 'hidden' PIDs.
